It was a gloomy day. The day was very gloomy, and it suddenly started to rain very heavily in Virginia.
Everyone left the streets, but rain got into the buildings! However, an abandoned building 
nearby was completely dry inside, and Emma had no choice but to shelter in the building.
Once she opened the door, she found Robert Pattinson inside! She stood in shock and gave him a big kiss.
Robert immediately pulled away when she slobbered all over him. A large gust of wind blew them to the ground.
