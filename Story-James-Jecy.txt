I woke up this morning. I was very tired. First, I looked out the window 
and saw the sun shining over the house in the distance. All of a sunnden, 
a cloud approached the same house and aliens started to emerge from their 
strange looking UFO and demanded that humanity give them their houses 
back. The aliens cited eminent domain and started walking down together 
and evicting all the townsfolk. Everyone was asleep but me! Luckily, I 
used my law and dialed on my phone a good lawyer to sue the aliens outside 
my window
