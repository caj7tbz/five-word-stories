There was a man somewhere, and every day he liked to water his plants with a certain chemical that would change their color. One day, he noticed that they were growing way too quickly. So, he called his botanist friend, which derailed into a conversation about the strange animal that had been moseying around their town. The neighbors were afraid that the animal would eat all of the crops and the man was worried his plants would be destroyed. So, they made a plan to protect themselves: the botanist used his plants to scare off the animal and everything was good. The end.
